/**
 * we can create threads either with Runnable interfaces or with Thread classes
 * as below. what approach to prefer?
 *
 * Usually using the Runnable interface approach is preferred.
 * if we extends Thread then we canâ€™t extend any other class (usually a huge disadvantage)
 * because in Java a given class can extends one class exclusively
 *
 * a class may implement more interfaces as well -
 * so implementing the Runnable interface can do no harm in the software logic (now or in the future)
